## Description

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://apixa25.github.io/work-day-scheduler/)

This is a simple workday planner. It includes the time blocks of a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù 9AM-5PM work day. It allows the user to store notes by hour. These notes will stay in the browser's memory until the user decides to delete them. This is referred to as ‚Äúpersistent‚Äù storage. It‚Äôs nice because a person can put some notes down, save them, then close the browser and the next time they open the browser they will not be lost they will be right where they left them!

I built this to show my ability to work with JavaScript and jQuery. The HTML is coded using Bootstrap extensively to make the forms and set the custom CSS elements. Where it gets interesting is the use of JavaScript and jQuery to make the functionality. What they do is allow each of the time boxes to be treated independently. A user can save info to each box. Also, there is a cool color effect built that shows the current time block in red, the future in green and the past in grey. These color blocks shift in real-time. This was accomplished with day.js and jQuery together.

## Usage

Can be used to make and keep notes in a way organized by hour time blocks. And will display them back to the user in a colorful way to indicate where the note is in real-time. If the note is in red it‚Äôs right now. üòÅ
